    "description": "Device Control skill is the primary and one of the most important and complex skills for Neon\u2019s internal controls. It goes hand-in-hand with Neon\u2019s User Settings Control skill. Those two skills provide similar functionality but are separated logically. Device Control skill is the \u201cbrain\u201d behind customization and control of Neon\u2019s device. It is responsible for: -   Changing dialog modes; -   Clearing recorded likes, audio, selected and full text transcriptions, and the rest of the user\u2019s data; -   Audible commands to switch between skipping and requiring wake words in two modes: dev and user; -   Enabling, disabling, and configuring gestures; -   Shutting down the whole device; -   Exiting from Neon\u2019s process; -   Showing and cancelling demo, including the question of the first startup; -   Manual updates requests;",
